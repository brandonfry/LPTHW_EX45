Exercise 45 from Learn Python the Hard Way.

This project is completed at the first commit. (I'll focus on using github during my next project.) The files run a Python dungeon crawler, with text based input and a rudimentary map system. The dungeon and monsters are randomnly generated. The user guides the hero through a single dungeon level. It would be trivial to feed the dungeon exit into a new level with more difficult monsters/larger mobs.
